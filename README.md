# DamageEvents

This resource provides events for pretty much all entity related damage or death events by listening to the `gameEventTriggered` event, taking the data and triggering new events based on that game event data.

## Download

You can download it [**here**](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/damageevents/releases/latest).

----

## Debugging

There is an option in the `fxmanifest.lua` file that allows you to turn on debug prints. This will print all triggered events to the F8 console. Note that you should disable this on your live server because it does reduce performance, and it just spams the console and client log of your users.

----

## Events reference

There are 8 events in total, all of which have been documented below.

All events are triggered on the **CLIENT SIDE** only, there is no server side events with network ID's.

Note, only one event will be triggered for every game event. Only the one that's most appropriate in any given situation will be used.

For example, if a player kills a ped, only the `DamageEvents:PedKilledByPlayer` event will be triggered, events like `DamageEvents:PedDied` or `DamageEvents:EntityKilled` will not be triggered in that case.
